  <p>Initially <b>available</b> only in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia"> English Wikipedia</a>, versions in other <strong>languages</strong> were quickly developed. Wikipedia's combined editions comprise more than 61 <i>million</i> articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 15 million edits per month (about 5.7 edits per second on average) as of January 2023.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">domains</a> wikipedia.com (later redirecting to <mark>wikipedia.org)</mark> and wikipedia.org were <small>registered</small> on January 12, 2001,[25] and January 13, 2001,[26] respectively, and <strike>Wikipedia</strike> was launched on January 15, 2001[18] as a <u>single English-language</u> edition at www.wikipedia.com,[27] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[21] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia.[28][29] Its integral policy of "neutral point-of-view"[30] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[21] Bomis originally <ins>intended it as a business for profit.[31]</ins>
